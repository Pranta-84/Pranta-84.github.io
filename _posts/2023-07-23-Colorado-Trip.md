At the end of July 2023, I went on a three-day trip to Colorado, USA.
During the trip, I visited Estes Park, the Alpine Visitor Center, Pikes Peak, Seven Falls, and Grand Lake—so many places in just three days! This was my first trip within the US since coming to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln for my MS in 2022.

I was the only person in the group who didn’t know how to drive—lol—so the rest of the group handled all the driving. I couldn’t help but wonder what it would feel like to drive on those beautiful roads in Colorado.
