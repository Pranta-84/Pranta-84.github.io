During my travel from the US to Bangladesh, I had an 8-hour layover in Seattle, Washington. In that short time, I managed to visit Lake Washington and Alki Beach Park. Between the two, I preferred Lake Washington, although Alki Beach Park also offered some beautiful scenic views.

I drove most of the time during this brief visit—lol—so it was a nice experience driving on the roads of Washington. There are many other beautiful places to see in the state, and I hope to explore them someday.

While driving, I had to pass through downtown Seattle, so technically, I did visit it—though not in the most ideal way. Seattle is the first major city I’ve visited in the US, and I hope I get more opportunities to visit others in the future.
