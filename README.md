Hi, this is Pranta.
I am a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Licoln (UNL). My research involves building methodology for pooled testing also known as group testing. The goal of pooled testing is to identify positive/negative specimens in less number of tests needed in traditional testing. Currently me and my advisor [Chris Bilder]([https://](https://statistics.unl.edu/person/christopher-bilder/) are investigating the usage of LASSO for identification purpose of pooled testing. Before enrolling into the PhD program I have obtained my Master of Science in Statistics from the UNL. Prior to my time at UNL, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Statistics from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I was born and brought up in Chandpur, Bangladesh; however I moved to Dhaka in 2016 for getting my Bachelor of Science. In my free time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, travel, or excercise.
